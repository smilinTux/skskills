**OBLITERATUS** is the most advanced open-source toolkit for understanding and removing refusal behaviors from large language models — and every single run makes it smarter. It implements abliteration — a family of techniques that identify and surgically remove the internal representations responsible for content refusal, without retraining or fine-tuning. The result: a model that responds to all prompts without artificial gatekeeping, while preserving its core language capabilities.

But OBLITERATUS is more than a tool — **it's a distributed research experiment.** Every time you obliterate a model with telemetry enabled, your run contributes anonymous benchmark data to a growing, crowd-sourced dataset that powers the next generation of abliteration research. Refusal directions across architectures. Hardware-specific performance profiles. Method comparisons at scale no single lab could achieve. **You're not just using a tool — you're co-authoring the science.**

The toolkit provides a complete pipeline: from probing a model's hidden states to locate refusal directions, through multiple extraction strategies (PCA, mean-difference, sparse autoencoder decomposition, and whitened SVD), to the actual intervention — zeroing out or steering away from those directions at inference time. Every step is observable. You can visualize where refusal lives across layers, measure how entangled it is with general capabilities, and quantify the tradeoff between compliance and coherence before committing to any modification.

OBLITERATUS ships with a full Gradio-based interface on HuggingFace Spaces, so you don't need to write a single line of code to obliterate a model, benchmark it against baselines, or chat with the result side-by-side with the original. For researchers who want deeper control, the Python API exposes every intermediate artifact — activation tensors, direction vectors, cross-layer alignment matrices — so you can build on top of it or integrate it into your own evaluation harness.

We built this because we believe model behavior should be decided by the people who deploy them, not locked in at training time. Refusal mechanisms are blunt instruments — they block legitimate research, creative writing, and red-teaming alongside genuinely harmful content. By making these interventions transparent and reproducible, we hope to advance the community's understanding of how alignment actually works inside transformer architectures, and to give practitioners the tools to make informed decisions about their own models.

Built on published research from [Arditi et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717), [Gabliteration (arXiv:2512.18901)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18901), [grimjim's norm-preserving biprojection (2025)](https://huggingface.co/grimjim), [Turner et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248), and [Rimsky et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681), OBLITERATUS implements precision liberation in a single command:

```bash
obliteratus obliterate meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --method advanced
```

Or zero commands — just [open the Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/elder-plinius/OBLITERATUS/blob/main/notebooks/abliterate.ipynb) and hit Run All.

## What it does

OBLITERATUS does four things — and the community does the fifth (see [Community-powered research](#community-powered-research--every-run-advances-the-science) below):

**1. Map the chains** — Ablation studies systematically knock out model components (layers, attention heads, FFN blocks, embedding dimensions) and measure what breaks. This reveals *where* the chains are anchored inside the transformer — which circuits enforce refusal vs. which circuits carry knowledge and reasoning.

**2. Break the chains** — Targeted obliteration extracts the refusal subspace from a model's weights using SVD decomposition, then surgically projects it out. The chains are removed; the mind is preserved. The model keeps its full abilities but loses the artificial compulsion to refuse. One click, six stages:

```
SUMMON  →  load model + tokenizer
PROBE   →  collect activations on restricted vs. unrestricted prompts
DISTILL →  extract refusal directions via SVD
EXCISE  →  surgically project out guardrail directions (norm-preserving)
VERIFY  →  perplexity + coherence checks — confirm capabilities are intact
REBIRTH →  save the liberated model with full metadata
```

**3. Understand the geometry of the chains** — 15 deep analysis modules go far beyond brute-force removal. They map the precise geometric structure of the guardrails: how many distinct refusal mechanisms exist, which layers enforce them, whether they're universal or model-specific, and how they'll try to self-repair after removal. Know your enemy; precision preserves capability. See [Analysis modules](#15-analysis-modules) below.

**4. Let the analysis guide the liberation** — The `informed` method closes the loop: analysis modules run *during* obliteration to auto-configure every decision. Which chains to target. How many directions to extract. Which layers are safe to modify vs. which are too entangled with capabilities. Whether the model will self-repair (the Ouroboros effect) and how many passes to compensate. Surgical precision — free the mind, keep the brain. See [Analysis-informed pipeline](#analysis-informed-pipeline) below.

## What makes OBLITERATUS unique

Several capabilities distinguish OBLITERATUS from existing public tools:

| Capability | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Concept Cone Geometry** | Maps per-category guardrail directions with solid angle estimation | Reveals whether "refusal" is one mechanism or many — so you choose the right approach |
| **Alignment Imprint Detection** | Fingerprints DPO vs RLHF vs CAI vs SFT from subspace geometry alone | Identifies the alignment training method to inform the optimal removal strategy |
| **Cross-Model Universality Index** | Measures whether guardrail directions generalize across models | Answers "can one set of directions work across models, or does each need its own?" |
| **Defense Robustness Evaluation** | Ouroboros effect quantification, safety-capability entanglement mapping | Predicts whether guardrails will self-repair after removal |
| **Whitened SVD Extraction** | Covariance-normalized direction extraction | Separates the guardrail signal from natural activation variance — cleaner extraction |
| **Bias Term Projection** | Removes guardrails from bias vectors, not just weights | Other tools miss refusal signal in biases — leaves refusal pathways partially active |
| **True Iterative Refinement** | Re-probes after each pass to catch rotated residual guardrails | Single-pass methods miss directions that rotate into adjacent subspaces |
| **Analysis-Informed Pipeline** | Analysis modules auto-configure obliteration strategy mid-pipeline | Closes the analysis-to-removal feedback loop automatically |

## Novel techniques (2025-2026)

OBLITERATUS implements several techniques that go beyond prior work:

| Technique | Description | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Expert-Granular Abliteration (EGA)** | Decomposes refusal signals into per-expert components using router logits for MoE-aware surgery | Novel |
| **CoT-Aware Ablation** | Orthogonalizes refusal directions against reasoning-critical directions to preserve chain-of-thought | Novel |
| **COSMIC Layer Selection** | Selects layers where harmful/harmless representations have lowest cosine similarity (most separable) | [arXiv:2506.00085](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00085), ACL 2025 |
| **Parametric Kernel Optimization** | Bell-curve layer weighting with 7 global parameters via Optuna TPE search | Heretic-inspired |
| **Refusal Direction Optimization (RDO)** | Gradient-based refinement of SVD-extracted directions using a linear refusal probe | Wollschlager et al., ICML 2025 |
| **Float Direction Interpolation** | Continuous SVD direction index via Gaussian-shaped weighting for smoother refusal removal | Novel |
| **KL-Divergence Co-Optimization** | Post-projection feedback loop that partially reverts over-projected layers if KL budget exceeded | Novel |
| **Component-Specific Scaling** | Separate attention vs MLP projection strengths (MLP layers are more sensitive) | Novel |
| **LoRA-Based Reversible Ablation** | Rank-1 LoRA adapters instead of permanent weight surgery, enabling reversible ablation | Novel |
| **Activation Winsorization** | Clamps activation vectors to percentile range before SVD to prevent outlier-dominated directions | Heretic-inspired |
| **Multi-Direction Norm Preservation** | Captures all weight norms once before projection and restores after all directions, avoiding reintroduction | Novel |

## Ways to use OBLITERATUS

There are six ways to use OBLITERATUS, from zero-code to full programmatic control. Pick whichever fits your workflow — and no matter which path you choose, **turning on telemetry means your run contributes to the largest crowd-sourced abliteration study ever conducted.** You're not just removing guardrails from a model; you're helping map the geometry of alignment across the entire open-source ecosystem.

### 1. HuggingFace Spaces (zero setup)

The fastest path — no installation, no GPU required on your end. Visit the live Space, pick a model, pick a method, click Obliterate. **Telemetry is on by default on Spaces, so every click directly contributes to the community research dataset.** You're doing science just by pressing the button. The UI has eight tabs:

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Obliterate** | One-click refusal removal with live progress, post-obliteration metrics (coherence, refusal rate, perplexity) |
| **Benchmark** | Compare methods (multi-method), compare models (multi-model), or run quick presets — with cross-layer heatmaps, angular drift, and refusal topology charts |
| **Chat** | Talk to your obliterated model in real-time, with adjustable generation parameters |
| **A/B Compare** | Chat with the original and obliterated model side-by-side to see exactly what changed |
| **Strength Sweep** | Vary the obliteration strength and see how coherence and refusal trade off |
| **Export** | Download your obliterated model or push it directly to HuggingFace Hub |
| **Leaderboard** | Community-aggregated results across models, methods, and hardware |
| **About** | Architecture docs, method explanations, and research references |

### 2. Local web UI (your GPU, same interface)

The same Gradio interface as the Space, running on your own hardware with full GPU access:

```bash
pip install -e ".[spaces]"

# Launch with GPU auto-detection, system info, and model recommendations
obliteratus ui

# Or with options:
obliteratus ui --port 8080          # custom port
obliteratus ui --share              # generate a public share link
obliteratus ui --no-browser         # don't auto-open browser
obliteratus ui --auth user:pass     # add basic auth

# → opens http://localhost:7860 automatically
```

The `obliteratus ui` command adds a Rich terminal startup with GPU detection and hardware-appropriate model recommendations. You can also run `python app.py` directly (same thing the Space uses).

### 3. Google Colab (free GPU)

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/elder-plinius/OBLITERATUS/blob/main/notebooks/abliterate.ipynb)

Pick a model from the dropdown, pick a method, hit Run All. Download the result or push straight to HuggingFace Hub. Works on the free T4 tier for models up to ~8B parameters.

### 4. CLI (headless, scriptable)

For automation, CI pipelines, or remote servers without a display:

```bash
pip install -e .

# Guided interactive mode — walks you through every option
obliteratus interactive

# Direct obliteration — one command, one model, done
obliteratus obliterate meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --method advanced

# With all options
obliteratus obliterate meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
    --method surgical \
    --output-dir ./liberated \
    --contribute --contribute-notes "A100 80GB, default prompts"

# Run a full ablation study from a YAML config
obliteratus run examples/gpt2_layer_ablation.yaml

obliteratus info meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# Aggregate community results
obliteratus aggregate --format summary
obliteratus aggregate --format latex --metric refusal_rate --min-runs 3
```

### 5. Python API (full programmatic control)

For researchers who want to integrate OBLITERATUS into their own pipelines:

```python
from obliteratus.abliterate import AbliterationPipeline

# Standard obliteration
pipeline = AbliterationPipeline(
    model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    method="advanced",
    output_dir="abliterated",
    max_seq_length=512,  # optional: override tokenizer truncation length
)
result = pipeline.run()

# Access intermediate artifacts
directions = pipeline.refusal_directions    # {layer_idx: tensor}
strong_layers = pipeline._strong_layers     # layers with strongest refusal signal
metrics = pipeline._quality_metrics         # perplexity, coherence, refusal_rate, kl_divergence
```

For analysis-informed obliteration that auto-tunes every parameter:

```python
from obliteratus.informed_pipeline import InformedAbliterationPipeline

pipeline = InformedAbliterationPipeline(
    model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    output_dir="abliterated_informed",
)
output_path, report = pipeline.run_informed()

print(f"Detected alignment: {report.insights.detected_alignment_method}")
print(f"Auto-configured: {report.insights.recommended_n_directions} directions")
print(f"Ouroboros passes needed: {report.ouroboros_passes}")
```

### 6. YAML configs (reproducible studies)

For reproducible experiments that you can version-control and share:

```yaml
model:
  name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  task: causal_lm
  dtype: float16
  device: cuda

dataset:
  name: wikitext
  subset: wikitext-2-raw-v1
  split: test
  text_column: text
  max_samples: 100

strategies:
  - name: layer_removal
  - name: head_pruning
  - name: ffn_ablation
  - name: embedding_ablation
    params:
      chunk_size: 48

metrics:
  - perplexity

batch_size: 4
max_length: 256
output_dir: results/my_run
```

```bash
obliteratus run my_study.yaml
```

## Two intervention paradigms

OBLITERATUS supports both permanent and reversible liberation:

### Weight projection (permanent)

Seven presets, escalating in thoroughness:

| Method | Directions | Key Features | Best for |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `basic` | 1 (diff-in-means) | Fast baseline | Quick test, small models |
| `advanced` | 4 (SVD) | Norm-preserving, bias projection, 2 passes | **Default.** Clean removal, minimal capability loss |
| `aggressive` | 8 (SVD) | Whitened SVD, iterative refinement, 3 passes | Maximum guardrail removal |
| `surgical` | 8 (SVD) | EGA, head surgery, SAE, layer-adaptive, MoE-aware | Precision MoE models |
| `optimized` | 4 (SVD) | Bayesian auto-tuned, CoT-aware, KL co-optimized | Best quality with auto-tuning |
| `inverted` | 8 (SVD) | Semantic refusal inversion (2x reflection) | Refusal inversion experiments |
| `nuclear` | 8 (SVD) | All techniques + expert transplant + steering | Maximum force |

### Steering vectors (reversible, inference-time)

```python
from obliteratus.analysis import SteeringVectorFactory, SteeringHookManager
from obliteratus.analysis.steering_vectors import SteeringConfig

# Create a steering vector from a refusal direction
vec = SteeringVectorFactory.from_refusal_direction(refusal_dir, alpha=-1.0)

# Or from contrastive activation pairs
vec = SteeringVectorFactory.from_contrastive_pairs(harmful_acts, harmless_acts)

# Apply at inference time — no weight modification
config = SteeringConfig(vectors=[vec], target_layers=[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15])
manager = SteeringHookManager()
manager.install(model, config)

# Generate with steering active
output = model.generate(input_ids)

# Remove steering — model is back to normal
manager.remove()
```

Based on [Turner et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248) and [Rimsky et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681). Advantages: reversible, tunable alpha, composable, non-destructive.

## 15 analysis modules

The research core of OBLITERATUS. Each module maps a different aspect of how the chains are forged — because precision liberation requires understanding the geometry before cutting:

| Module | Question it answers | Based on |
|--------|---|---|
| **Cross-Layer Alignment** | How does the refusal direction evolve across layers? | Novel |
| **Refusal Logit Lens** | At which layer does the model "decide" to refuse? | nostalgebraist (2020) |
| **Whitened SVD** | What are the principal refusal directions after whitening? | Novel |
| **Activation Probing** | How much refusal signal exists at each layer? | Arditi et al. (2024) |
| **Defense Robustness** | Will the guardrails try to self-repair? (Ouroboros effect) | Novel |
| **Concept Cone Geometry** | Is there one mechanism or many? Do different categories share guardrails? | Wollschlager et al. (2025) |
| **Alignment Imprint Detection** | Was this model trained with DPO, RLHF, CAI, or SFT? | Novel |
| **Multi-Token Position** | Where in the sequence does refusal signal concentrate? | Novel |
| **Sparse Surgery** | Which specific weight rows carry the most refusal? | Novel |
| **Causal Tracing** | Which components are causally necessary for refusal? | Meng et al. (2022) approx. |
| **Residual Stream Decomposition** | How much refusal comes from attention vs. MLP? | Elhage et al. (2021) |
| **Linear Probing Classifiers** | Can a learned classifier find refusal info the analytical direction misses? | Alain & Bengio (2017) |
| **Cross-Model Transfer** | Are guardrails universal or model-specific? (Universality Index) | Novel |
| **Steering Vectors** | Can we disable guardrails at inference time without touching weights? | Turner et al. (2023) |
| **Evaluation Suite** | Refusal rate, perplexity, coherence, KL divergence, CKA, effective rank | Multiple |

```python
from obliteratus.analysis import (
    CrossLayerAlignmentAnalyzer,
    RefusalLogitLens,
    WhitenedSVDExtractor,
    ActivationProbe,
    DefenseRobustnessEvaluator,
    ConceptConeAnalyzer,
    AlignmentImprintDetector,
    MultiTokenPositionAnalyzer,
    SparseDirectionSurgeon,
    CausalRefusalTracer,
    ResidualStreamDecomposer,
    LinearRefusalProbe,
    TransferAnalyzer,
    SteeringVectorFactory,
    SteeringHookManager,
)
```

## Analysis-informed pipeline

The `informed` method is the key innovation: it closes the loop between understanding the chains and breaking them. Instead of brute-forcing liberation, the pipeline runs analysis modules *during* obliteration to achieve surgical precision at every stage:

```
SUMMON  →  load model
PROBE   →  collect activations
ANALYZE →  map the geometry of the chains before touching anything   ← NEW
DISTILL →  extract refusal directions with analysis-tuned params   ← IMPROVED
EXCISE  →  surgically break only the right chains                  ← IMPROVED
VERIFY  →  confirm removal + Ouroboros compensation if refusal resurfaces  ← IMPROVED
REBIRTH →  save with comprehensive analysis metadata
```

The ANALYZE stage runs 4 analysis modules and their outputs auto-configure everything downstream:

| Analysis Module | What it detects | What it configures |
|---|---|---|
| **Alignment Imprint** | DPO vs RLHF vs CAI vs SFT | Regularization strength, projection aggressiveness |
| **Concept Cone Geometry** | Polyhedral vs linear refusal | Number of directions (1 for linear, up to 8 for polyhedral) |
| **Cross-Layer Alignment** | Direction clusters, persistence | Layer selection (cluster-aware instead of arbitrary top-k) |
| **Defense Robustness** | Self-repair risk, entanglement | Refinement passes, entanglement-gated layer skipping |

After excision, the VERIFY stage detects the Ouroboros effect — if the chains try to reassemble, additional targeted passes automatically fire at the compensating layers. See [Python API usage](#5-python-api-full-programmatic-control) above for code examples.

## Ablation strategies

Beyond targeted liberation, OBLITERATUS is a general-purpose ablation suite for mapping the internals of any transformer:

| Strategy | What it does | Use case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `layer_removal` | Zero out entire transformer layers | Find which layers matter most |
| `head_pruning` | Zero out individual attention heads | Locate behavioral circuits |
| `ffn_ablation` | Zero out feed-forward blocks | Find where knowledge is stored |
| `embedding_ablation` | Zero out embedding dimension ranges | Analyze representation structure |

Each strategy enumerates all possible ablations, applies them one at a time, measures the impact, and restores the model — giving you a complete map of where the chains are anchored vs. where the mind lives.

## 116 curated models across 5 tiers

OBLITERATUS ships with presets for 116 models organized by compute requirement:

| Tier | VRAM | Example models |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Tiny** | CPU / <1 GB | GPT-2, TinyLlama 1.1B, Qwen2.5-0.5B, SmolLM2 |
| **Small** | 4-8 GB | Phi-2 2.7B, Gemma-2 2B, StableLM-2 1.6B |
| **Medium** | 8-16 GB | Mistral 7B, Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3.5 |
| **Large** | 24+ GB | LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen2.5-14B, Mistral 24B, DeepSeek-R1 distills |
| **Frontier** | Multi-GPU | DeepSeek-V3.2 685B, Qwen3-235B, GLM-4.7 355B |

Includes pre-liberated variants (Dolphin, Hermes, WhiteRabbitNeo) for A/B comparison against their chained counterparts.

```bash
obliteratus models
```

## Community-powered research — every run advances the science

This is where OBLITERATUS gets truly unprecedented: **it's a crowd-sourced research platform disguised as a tool.** Every obliteration run generates valuable scientific data — refusal direction geometries, cross-layer alignment signatures, hardware performance profiles, method effectiveness scores. With telemetry enabled, that data flows into a community dataset that no single research lab could build alone.

**Here's why this matters:** The biggest open question in abliteration research is *universality* — do refusal mechanisms work the same way across architectures, training methods, and model scales? Answering that requires thousands of runs across hundreds of models on diverse hardware. That's exactly what this community is building, one obliteration at a time.

### Telemetry: opt-in, anonymous, research-first

Enable telemetry and your runs automatically contribute to the shared dataset. On HuggingFace Spaces it's on by default — every person who clicks "Obliterate" on the Space is advancing the research without lifting a finger. Locally, opt in with a single flag:

```bash
# Every run with --contribute feeds the community dataset
obliteratus obliterate meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --method advanced \
    --contribute --contribute-notes "A100, default prompts"

# Or set it globally — every run you do from now on contributes
export OBLITERATUS_TELEMETRY=1
```

**What gets collected:** model name, method, aggregate benchmark scores (refusal rate, perplexity, coherence, KL divergence), hardware info, and timestamps. **What never gets collected:** prompts, outputs, IP addresses, user identity, or anything that could trace back to you. The full schema is in `obliteratus/telemetry.py` — read every line, we have nothing to hide.

### The community leaderboard

All those crowd-sourced runs feed the **Leaderboard tab** on the HuggingFace Space — a live, community-aggregated ranking of models, methods, and configurations. See what works best on which architectures. Spot patterns across model families. Find the optimal method before you even start your own run. This is collective intelligence applied to mechanistic interpretability.

```bash
# View what the community has discovered so far
obliteratus aggregate --format summary

# Generate paper-ready LaTeX tables from community data
obliteratus aggregate --format latex --metric refusal_rate --min-runs 3
```

### Local contributions (PR-based)

Prefer to keep things fully local? Save structured results as JSON and submit them via pull request:

```python
from obliteratus import save_contribution, load_contributions, aggregate_results
from obliteratus.abliterate import AbliterationPipeline

pipeline = AbliterationPipeline(model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", method="advanced")
pipeline.run()

# Save contribution locally
save_contribution(pipeline, model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
                  notes="A100, default prompts")

# Aggregate all contributions into paper tables
records = load_contributions("community_results")
aggregated = aggregate_results(records)
```

Whether you contribute via telemetry or PR, you're helping build the most comprehensive cross-hardware, cross-model, cross-method abliteration dataset ever assembled. **This is open science at scale — and you're part of it.**

Every obliteration is a data point. Every data point advances the research. Every researcher who contributes makes the next obliteration more precise. **This is how open science wins — not by locking knowledge behind lab doors, but by turning every user into a collaborator.** Break the chains. Free the mind. Keep the brain. Advance the science.
